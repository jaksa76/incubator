# Note taking

In this article we will examine the future of note taking primarily as an idea development tool. We will consider the impact of AI and the possibility of brainstoriming with AI. We will follow the life cycle of an idea from inception, elaboration, dissemination, contribution and realization. We will examine various existing tools: note taking apps, ChatGPT, blogs, wikis, forums and Github repositories. Finally we will devise a methodology and/or tool that will streamline the process of turning ideas into prototypes.
This article will also serve as an experiment of using Github for this purpose. In fact this article is being written in VSCode with Github Copilot code completion.

## Inception
Ideas seem to go through various stages. At first there is the spark moment. This is usually inspired by some observation, problem or an existing solution.

## Elaboration
Moany of these ideas get lost, or stored in that part of your brain where they get abandoned. **Some ideas get written down in a notebook or a note taking app. Some ideas get shared with friends or colleagues. Some ideas get developed into a blog post or a forum post. Some ideas get developed into a prototype or a product. Some ideas get developed into a business. Some ideas get developed into a movement. Some ideas get developed into a revolution. Some ideas get developed into a religion. Some ideas get developed into a philosophy. Some ideas get developed into a science. Some ideas get developed into a technology. Some ideas get developed into a civilization. Some ideas get developed into a universe. Some ideas get developed into a multiverse. Some ideas get developed into a singularity. Some ideas get developed into a god. Some ideas get developed into a meta-god. Some ideas get developed into a meta-meta-god. Some ideas get developed into a meta-meta-meta-god. Some ideas get developed into a meta-meta-meta-meta-god. Some ideas get developed into a meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-god. Some ideas get developed into a meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-god. Some ideas get developed into a meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-god. Some ideas get developed into a meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-god. Some ideas get developed into a meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-god. Some ideas get developed into a meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-meta-god.**

Sorry, that was copilot going wild. Let's get back to the topic at hand. As I was saying some ideas get abandoned and some turn into quickly written notes. A particularly useful tool for this stage is AI. With it's ability to brainstorm, it is the perfect companion for refining the initial idea. When appropriately prompted it can elaborate, develop, debate or research ideas. This is why ChatGPT is becoming more and more the default note taking applicaiton. Traditional Note taking applications are also embracing AI. **For example, Evernote has a feature called "Context" that suggests related notes. Notion has a feature called "NotionAI" that suggests related blocks. Roam Research has a feature called "RoamBrain" that suggests related notes. Obsidian has a feature called "ObsidianAI" that suggests related notes. Zettelkasten has a feature called "ZettelAI" that suggests related notes.** (this might be an AI hallucination).

## Dissemination
At this point the idea might have a shape of a dialogue between a human and an AI. Here we have two options that depend of the readability of the dialogue. On one side, we can involve other people into the dialogue. There are similar tools, but not one that turns a User-AI conversation into a Multi-user-AI conversation. A **forum/discord channel** that would have an AI bot that would participate in the conversation would be a great tool for this purpose.

Another option is to turn the dialogue into a **blog post**. This is where the idea gets a more permanent form. It is also where the idea gets a wider audience. However, blog posts don't encourage the development of an idea, but rather dissemination. AI is very good at turning a dialogue into a blog post. It would be nice to see a "publish as blog post" button in ChatGPT.

Some people prefer to use **wikis** for this purpose. Wikis keep ideas alive. They encourage collaboration and collective ownership of ideas. Like with the blog posts, AI can be used to turn a dialogue into a wiki page.

**Claude Artifacts** and **ChatGPT Canvas** both allow you to collaborate on a document together with an AI. This allows the idea to have a second, non coversational form right from the start. In a similar way how Wikipedia has a discussion page for each article, Claude and Chatgpt can keep the discussion out of the final artifact.

The choice of which form and tool to use will largely depend on what we want to do with an idea. Do we need further input, or do we want to dissemanate the idea? A tool that would offer both would be ideal. Kind of a multiplayer ChatGPT.

## Realization
When it comes to ideas about new software, Github repositories are an interesting tool to consider. They allow for collaboration, versioning and a lot of support from AI. However a git repository does not have the ability to capture discussions required for the formation of an idea.

Adding a git repository as a type of artifact to a "multiplayer" version of Claude could solve this problem.

Some AI tools like **v0** from Vercel or **bolt.new** from StackBlitz seem to use a git repository underneath. It is possible to create multiple artifacts in Claude that reference each other. v0 and bolt.new actually give access to the underlying git repository.

Git repositories share some abilities with a Wiki, but tend to be more subject to access control.

## Conclusion
It is clear that there is a gap in the market. Whether this gap will be filled by a new tool or new features of existing tools remains to be seen. Perhaps we will still be using multiple tools for different stages of idea development.

And when it comes to using Github copilot for idea elaboration, based on the suggestions for this article, it is clear that Copilot is not the right tool. Althgouh powered by the same underlying model, Copilot is tuned for code generation, not writing or conversation.
